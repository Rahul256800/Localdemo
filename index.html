        Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[158][237] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[238] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[38] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[239][240] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[238][239][240][241][242] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice
